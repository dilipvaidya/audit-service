# audit-service

## Problem Statement
Implement Audit services for a microservices based application.

Audit service is independent distributed service that, as name suggests, helps in auditing the changes made by all the 
other services in their respective resources. Other services generates change notification for the every modify 
operations, acts as producer of the event. Audit service, on the other hand, subscribed to the change notifications, 
acts as a consumers and process the audit messages by writing them into the audit database for future auditing 
capabilities also provided by the audit service. User, based on what audit messages are authorized, can access audit 
service for appropriate audit messages.

### Functional Goal
1. The audit service should subscribe to change notifications from all other services, process and save them into a standard format in the database.
2. Should provide APIs to view audit message, consider two personas for viewing 
   1. Admin who can view all audit messages
   2. Non-admin who can view only for entities he/she has access to
3. Should enable audit log rotation with configurable window.

### Non-functional Goals
1. Format of the audit message
2. Database of choice and schema design with considerations around performance
3. Safeguard against audit tampering
4. Considerations for cross-platform deployment
5. Considerations for capable deployment
6. Develop this service as a Spring Application
7. Deploy as a war in tomcat on a CentOS virtual machine.

### event broker
Audit Service is independent, highly distributed service that supports the handling of change notifications generated by
producer services. Producer services will generate the notifications into the message broker which audit services are 
subscribed to. There are a couple of options for message brokers to choose from as mentioned below.

### 📌 Pros & Cons Summary

#### **Apache Kafka** [selected for this implementation]
- ✅ Pros:
   - High throughput and scalability
   - Built-in durability and re-playability
   - Rich ecosystem (Kafka Streams, KSQL, Connect)
   - Mature in terms of Community, documentation, and long-term support
- ❌ Cons:
   - Operationally complex (ZooKeeper, partitions, brokers)
   - Overkill for simple or low-volume use cases

#### **Apache ActiveMQ**
- ✅ Pros:
   - Simple to set up with JMS support

### audit message format

#### 📝 Audit Log Format Design Criteria

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔑 `eventId`                     | Unique identifier (UUID) for the audit event                                | Ensures traceability and de-duplication                                   |
| 🕒 `timestamp`                   | ISO 8601 formatted timestamp of when the event occurred                     | Critical for ordering and time-range queries                              |
| 📦 `sourceService`              | The microservice that generated the event (e.g., user-service)             | Enables filtering and attribution of actions                              |
| 🔁 `eventType`                  | Type of event (e.g., USER_CREATED, RESOURCE_DELETED)                        | Helps in classification, filtering, and analytics                         |
| 🧩 `entityType` & `entityId`    | What was changed (e.g., User, Order) and its ID                             | Core reference to the subject of the change                               |
| 👤 `changedBy`                  | Who made the change — includes username, userId, and roles                  | Enables authorization checks and access filtering                         |
| 🔄 `changeSummary`              | What changed — structured diff of old vs new values                         | Enables rich history views and auditing fidelity                          |
| 🌐 `metadata`                   | Optional context (IP address, user agent, etc.)                             | Useful for forensic, compliance, and security audit trails                |
| 🧠 Schema Flexibility           | Support for evolving message structure (e.g., nested, optional fields)     | Important for long-term maintainability and compatibility                 |
| 🔐 Tamper Evident (optional)    | Signature or hash of message for integrity validation                       | Optional but important for security-sensitive environments                |
| 💬 Extensibility                | Should support adding new fields (e.g., tags, severity) over time          | Future-proofing the schema                                                |
| 🔎 Searchable Field Types       | Field types chosen to support fast and useful searches (e.g., keywords, nested) | Directly impacts performance in Elasticsearch or other search DBs     |
